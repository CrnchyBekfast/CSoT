# DevClub Summer of Code 2025

Welcome to Week 1 of the Game Development Track for DevClub Summer of Code 2024! This week marks the beginning of your journey into the world of game creation, Your initial focus will be on establishing a solid foundation in Unity and understanding the principles of engaging game design.

## Game Development : Week 1

Throughout this week, you'll set up your development environment, familiarize yourself with Unity's interface, and delve into the basics of C# scripting. Additionally, you'll begin conceptualizing your game by brainstorming ideas and drafting a Game Design Document (GDD), which will serve as a blueprint for your project.

By the end of Week 1, you should have a fully configured development setup, a basic understanding of Unity and C# scripting, and a clear vision for your game project. This foundation will prepare you for the exciting challenges and creative opportunities in the weeks to come.

### Step 4: Theme Brainstorming & Game Design Document

- **Analyze the provided themes and choose 2-3 to incorporate**
    
    Reflect on the themes provided for your project and select a few that resonate with your game's vision.
    
- **Brainstorm game mechanics that express your chosen themes**
    
    Think creatively about how your game's mechanics can embody the selected themes.
    
- **Create a Game Design Document (GDD) outlining:**
    - Core concept and themes
    - Gameplay mechanics
    - Basic narrative elements
    - 2D or 3D approach
    - Visual style
    - Minimum Viable Product (MVP) features([Unity Documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/2023.2/Documentation/Manual/UsingTheEditor.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/unity/comments/1d6ddbh/unity_visual_scripting_for_beginners_2024_tutorial/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
