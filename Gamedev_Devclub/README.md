## üéÆ DevClub Summer of Code 2025: Game Development Track

### Introduction

Welcome to the Game Development track of the DevClub Summer of Code 2025! This track focuses on teaching you how to create compelling games using Unity, one of the most popular game development engines in the industry. Over the next five weeks, you‚Äôll learn fundamental game development concepts, master Unity‚Äôs tools and workflows, and develop your own game incorporating creative themes.

## Why Game Development?

Game Dev is a powerful blend of creativity and technical skills:

- Learn programming, physics, and problem solving in a visual medium.
- Build immersive experiences through sound, art, and narrative.
- Collaborate across disciplines: design, programming, writing, and art.
- Understand how games shape culture, behavior, and emotions.

Game development also gives you tangible, playable outputs‚Äîgames you can showcase in portfolios and online stores!

## Why Learn Game Development with Unity?

Unity is an incredibly versatile and accessible game engine that powers everything from indie hits to AAA titles. Learning game development with Unity offers numerous advantages:

1. **Low barrier to entry**: Unity is beginner-friendly while still offering professional-grade capabilities
2. **Cross-platform development**: Build games for mobile, desktop, web, console, AR/VR, and more
3. **Massive community support**: Access to countless tutorials, assets, and community help
4. **Transferable skills**: Programming, design, problem-solving, and creative skills applicable across the tech industry
5. **Career opportunities**: Game development skills are in high demand across entertainment, simulation, education, and more

## Themes for Your Game

This year, we‚Äôre providing five thought-provoking themes to inspire your game creation. You should choose at least 2-3 of these themes to incorporate into your concept:

1. **Echoes of a Forgotten Past**: Explore memories, lost civilizations, ancient artifacts, or how history shapes the present
2. **Truth is a Glitch**: Play with reality distortion, unreliable perceptions, or systems that malfunction in revealing ways
3. **No One‚Äôs in Control**: Examine chaos, unpredictability, systems beyond human control, or the illusion of control
4. **Looping Consequences**: Implement time loops, cause-and-effect chains, repeated patterns, or cyclical narratives
5. **This Isn‚Äôt Real**: Delve into dreams, illusions, simulations, virtual realities, or questioning what ‚Äúreality‚Äù means

During Week 1, you‚Äôll brainstorm and develop a game concept that weaves together your chosen themes.

## 2D vs 3D Development

You‚Äôll have the freedom to choose whether to develop your game in 2D or 3D based on your interests and creative vision:

- **2D Development**: Generally simpler for beginners, focuses on sprite-based graphics, and works well for platformers, puzzle games, and top-down adventures
- **3D Development**: More complex but offers immersive worlds, works well for first-person experiences, third-person adventures, and simulation games

We‚Äôll provide resources for both paths, and you can make your decision during Week 1 when forming your game concept.**Creative expression**: Blend technical skills with artistic vision to create interactive experiences

## What We'll Be Building

Over five weeks, you'll build an atmospheric 2D (or simple 3D) game prototype, with:

- A controllable player character
- Dynamic environments with interactions
- A layered narrative system using the theme
- Game mechanics inspired by glitchy memories, loops, and false realities
- Optional: Dialogue systems, save/load functionality, and visual effects

---

## Tools and Technologies

We‚Äôll be using the following tools and technologies:

- **Unity 2023.3 LTS**: The core game engine (free for personal use)
- **Visual Studio/VS Code**: For C# scripting
- **C#**: The primary programming language for Unity development
- **Asset Store Resources**: Free and affordable assets to enhance your games
- **Version Control**: Git and GitHub for tracking changes and collaboration
- **Design Tools**:
    - 2D: Piskel (free), Aseprite, or other pixel art tools
    - 3D: Blender (free) for 3D modeling
- **Audio Tools**: Audacity (free) for sound editing
