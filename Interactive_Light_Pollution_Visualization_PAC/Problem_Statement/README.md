# Problem Statement: Interactive Light Pollution Visualization Platform for India

## Background

Artificial light pollution has emerged as a critical environmental challenge, fundamentally altering Earth's natural darkness and creating cascading effects across ecological, astronomical, and human health domains. India, experiencing unprecedented urbanization with over 600 million people expected in urban areas by 2031, presents a compelling case for developing comprehensive light pollution monitoring solutions.

Despite growing awareness of light pollution's impacts, there exists a significant gap in accessible, interactive tools that can visualize satellite nightlight data patterns for researchers, students, and environmental professionals. Current approaches often rely on static academic papers or complex datasets that are difficult to interpret and explore interactively.

## The Challenge

### Technical Gap
- **Data Accessibility**: Satellite nightlight data exists but remains largely inaccessible through user-friendly interfaces
- **Visualization Limitations**: Existing tools lack intuitive, interactive interfaces for exploring spatial and temporal patterns
- **Processing Barriers**: Raw satellite data requires significant preprocessing before visualization
- **Integration Challenges**: No unified platform combines multiple years of processed data with interactive exploration capabilities

### Indian Context
India's diverse geographical and developmental landscape presents unique visualization challenges:
- **Scale Complexity**: Vast territorial expanse requiring multi-scale visualization capabilities
- **Data Volume**: Multiple years of satellite data requiring efficient rendering and interaction
- **Regional Variations**: Different states and regions with varying urbanization patterns
- **Temporal Dynamics**: Seasonal patterns, festival lighting, and rapid development changes

## Project Vision: Interactive Light Pollution Visualization Platform
