## Key Topics and Resources

### Light Pollution Fundamentals

**Core Concepts:**
- Types of light pollution: skyglow, glare, light trespass, clutter
- Environmental impacts: ecological disruption, astronomical interference
- Measurement methods: ground-based vs satellite observations
- India-specific context: urbanization patterns, regional variations

**Essential Reading:**
1. [Light pollution and astronomy - Sky at Night Magazine](https://www.skyatnightmagazine.com/advice/light-pollution-astronomy)
2. [How to measure light pollution - systematic review](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/368577665_How_to_measure_light_pollution_-_a_systematic_review_of_methods_and_applications)
3. [Nighttime light data and applications](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2226585622000383)

### Satellite Data Sources

**VIIRS Day/Night Band:**
- Spatial resolution: ~750m at nadir
- Temporal coverage: 2012-present
- Radiometric calibration and dynamic range
- Monthly composite products and processing methods

**DMSP-OLS Historical Data:**  
- Spatial resolution: ~1km
- Temporal coverage: 1992-2013
- Limitations: saturation, lack of calibration
- Applications for long-term trend analysis

**Technical Resources:**
1. [VIIRS Nighttime Light - Earth Observation Group](https://eogdata.mines.edu/products/vnl/)
2. [Introduction to Nighttime Light Data - World Bank](https://worldbank.github.io/OpenNightLights/tutorials/mod1_2_introduction_to_nighttime_light_data.html)
3. NOAA VIIRS technical documentation
4. NASA Earthdata user guides

### System Architecture Design

**Architecture Components:**
- **Frontend**: Interactive mapping interface with temporal controls
- **Backend**: RESTful API for data serving and processing
- **Database**: Spatial database optimized for geospatial queries
- **Data Pipeline**: ETL workflows for satellite data preprocessing

**Design Considerations:**

- Performance optimization for real-time interactions
- Data storage formats and indexing strategies
- API design for efficient data retrieval

### Development Environment Setup

**Required Software:**
- **Code Editor**: VS Code, IntelliJ, or similar
- **Version Control**: Git with GitHub/GitLab
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with PostGIS extension

- **GIS Software**: QGIS for data exploration and validation
- **Testing Tools**: Postman for API testing
- **Monitoring**: Basic logging and performance monitoring

### Data Processing Pipeline

**Pipeline Components:**
1. **Data Acquisition**: Automated download from satellite archives
2. **Preprocessing**: Format conversion, quality control, atmospheric correction
3. **Spatial Processing**: Clipping to India boundaries, reprojection
4. **Temporal Processing**: Creating time series and temporal composites
5. **Database Loading**: Efficient storage with spatial indexing

**Data Formats:**
- **Input**: HDF5, NetCDF, GeoTIFF from satellite archives
- **Processing**: Standardized GeoTIFF with consistent projections
- **Storage**: Optimized formats for web serving (tiles, compressed)
