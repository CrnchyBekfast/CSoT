### CAIC Summer of Tech (CSoT) â€“ Aerial Robotics


 -Organized by AeroClub, IIT Delhi


As part of the CAIC Summer of Tech (CSoT) initiative, the Aerial Robotics problem statement aims to introduce students particularly first-year participants to the fundamentals of drone technology and autonomous aerial systems using a simulation-first approach.
Over the course of five weeks, participants will explore core concepts in multirotor dynamics, control systems (including PID), autonomous navigation, and visual perception using computer vision. All activities will be conducted in Webots, an open-source robotics simulator, ensuring accessibility and eliminating the need for physical drone hardware.


The structure emphasizes:


Understanding the physics and control behind drone flight


Writing Python-based controllers to execute tasks like takeoff, hover, navigation, and landing


Using camera sensors and OpenCV to implement real-time visual tracking and movement toward targets


Executing a complete mission-style simulation combining navigation and inspection


This problem statement is designed to be beginner-friendly, while still offering technical depth for those who wish to explore further. Participants will build a strong foundation in aerial robotics, preparing them for future involvement in AeroClub activities and the Inter-IIT Tech Meet 2025.
