## Hey frens 👋

You made it through the DeFi trenches — unscathed and leveled up.  
Now it’s time to **immortalize that journey** on-chain.

This isn’t some random JPEG drop.  
This is a **soulbound badge of honor** — non-transferable, non-fungible, and very well-earned.

## ✨ What's This?

We’re issuing **soulbound NFTs** to recognize your participation, effort, and contribution throughout the bootcamp.

> These are manually distributed and cannot be transferred. They live with you — like your memories, but on-chain.
