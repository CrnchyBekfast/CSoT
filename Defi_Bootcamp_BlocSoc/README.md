We're kicking off a 5-week bootcamp designed to get curious minds (yes, you! 👀) up to speed with DeFi and its economic impact in the world of Web3 🌐. Each week, you'll join online sessions, tackle weekly assignments (don’t worry, no pop quizzes... probably 😅), and wrap it all up with a capstone project that puts your skills to the test. 💪

By the end of the bootcamp, you'll be flexing your brainpower by writing your very own DEX (Decentralised Exchange) — because why just use one when you can build your own? 🛠️📈

## Hey frens 👋

Welcome to the **DeFi Summer Bootcamp** — an intense, community-led sprint through the wild world of decentralized finance.  
This isn’t just a course. It’s a movement.

If you’re here, you're either:
- Curious about how DeFi actually works,
- Hungry to build cool stuff onchain,
- Or just here for the vibes (and maybe an NFT 👀).

Whatever brought you — you’re in the right place.

- 📚 Deeper dives for the curious  
- 🧵 Twitter/X threads and blogs from community members
