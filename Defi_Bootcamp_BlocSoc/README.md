## Hey frens 👋

Welcome to the **DeFi Summer Bootcamp** — an intense, community-led sprint through the wild world of decentralized finance.  
This isn’t just a course. It’s a movement.

If you’re here, you're either:
- Curious about how DeFi actually works,
- Hungry to build cool stuff onchain,
- Or just here for the vibes (and maybe an NFT 👀).

Whatever brought you — you’re in the right place.

## 🧠 What’s This All About?

Think of this as your **DeFi builder onboarding**.  
Over the next 6 weeks, you’ll go from zero to onchain — learning about protocols, smart contracts, security, MEV, and more.  
And not just learning — actually building. Every week includes:

- 📖 Reading + resources  
- 🛠️ Assignments to get your hands dirty  
- 📚 Deeper dives for the curious  
- 🧵 Twitter/X threads and blogs from community members

## 📚 Weekly Modules

Each week builds on the last — from core concepts to real-world apps:

- 🔰 [Week 1: Introduction to DeFi](./week1)  
- 💱 [Week 2: DeFi Protocols](./week2)  
- ⚠️ [Week 3: Limitations of DeFi & Solutions](./week3)  
- 🧪 [Week 4 & 5: Research and Projects](./week4-5)
