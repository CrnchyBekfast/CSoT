# Hey everyone!
The vision behind organizing this bootcamp is to get everyone familiar with blockchain 🧠, help prepare for upcoming hackathons 🛠️, and provide non-members of the club an opportunity to explore the technology and dive deeper into it 🌐.

We aim to make the bootcamp as interactive as possible 🤝 by discussing real-world challenges 🌍 and limitations in existing systems, and by brainstorming new project ideas together 💡.

We also plan to hold weekly doubt-clearing sessions 🗓️ to support participants throughout the bootcamp.

Need some more incentive besides knowledge? We got you some — guess what — **NFTs**!!! 🎉🎨
