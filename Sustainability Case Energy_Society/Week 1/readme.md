# Week 1: Baseline Assessment & City Selection

---

## 🎯 Objective
- Select an Indian metro/urban city for your case study.  
- Gather baseline data on demographics, transport infrastructure, and modal shares.  
- Estimate annual transport CO₂ emissions.  
- Identify 2–3 key mobility challenges or opportunities.

---

## 📌 Key Tasks

1. **City Selection**  
   - Pick any Indian city (e.g., Bengaluru, Pune, Surat, Kolkata).  
   - Justify your choice: population size, growth rate, data availability, strategic importance.

2. **Baseline Transport Profile**  
   - **Demographics & Urban Form**  
     - Population, population density, urban area (km²).  
   - **Vehicle Stock & Modal Share**  
     - Number of 2-wheelers, 3-wheelers, cars, buses, metro ridership.  
     - % trips by each mode (use Census “Mode of Travel to Work” or city surveys).  
   - **Infrastructure Inventory**  
     - Total road network length, km of metro/BRT/cycle lanes.

3. **Emissions Baseline**  
   - Apply published emission factors (e.g. TERI, ICCT, or IPCC) to estimate annual CO₂ (tCO₂/yr) by mode.  
   - Document all assumptions (vehicle-km/day, load factors, emission factors).

  3. **Emissions Estimate Table** (tCO₂/yr by mode)  
  4. **Key Observations** (bullet points on challenges/opportunities)

- **Optional Attachments**:  
  - `baseline_data.xlsx` (spreadsheet of raw data)  
  - `city_map.png` (annotated map of transport network)
