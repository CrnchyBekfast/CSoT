# Sustainable Mobility Case Preparation

---

## üéØ Objective
Design a comprehensive low-emission transport strategy for an Indian metro/urban city of your choice. Your plan should reduce CO‚ÇÇ emissions, improve access, and promote clean modes of travel.

---

## üìå Challenge
- **Modal Shift**: Increase share of public & active modes (bus, metro, cycling, walking)  
- **Electrification**: Accelerate EV uptake (2-wheelers, 3-wheelers, buses) with charger network  
- **Policy & Pricing**: Propose reform (congestion charges, parking, fuel taxes, incentives)  
- **Infrastructure**: Outline transit expansions, BRT/cycle lanes, depot & charger siting  
- **Impact**: Quantify CO‚ÇÇ reduction, ridership growth, and equity benefits

---

## üåç Scope
- **Location**: Any Indian city (e.g. Bengaluru, Pune, Surat, Kolkata‚Ä¶)  
- **Target Year**: Choose a horizon (e.g. 2030 or 2040)  
- **Stakeholders**: City transport authority, state government, utilities, private operators, citizens  
- **References**: MoHUA/NUTP, NITI Aayog EV guidelines, Census mode-share data
