Supply chains are complex systems that coordinate the movement of goods, information,
and resources across a network of suppliers, manufacturers, warehouses, and distributors. Problems in supply chains often revolve around optimization — minimizing costs,
maximizing efficiency, ensuring timely delivery, and managing limited resources.
This project series introduces participants to the computational thinking needed to
analyze and solve such real-world logistics problems. Starting from foundational geometric and graph-based challenges, the series gradually builds toward more complex and
computationally intensive tasks.
The first two weeks focus on developing core intuitions — understanding spatial constraints, overlapping service regions, and how networks can represent logistics flows. In
later weeks, participants will explore classic combinatorial and packing problems, eventually confronting problems that are computationally hard in nature.
Through this progression, participants will gain insight into not just the structure of
supply chain issues, but also the algorithms, heuristics, and trade-offs used to tackle them
in practice.
