# ðŸ“¦ Understanding Supply Chains Through Computational Thinking

Supply chains are **complex systems** that coordinate the movement of **goods, information**, and **resources** across a network of suppliers, manufacturers, warehouses, and distributors.

Problems in supply chains often center around **optimization**:
- Minimizing costs  
- Maximizing efficiency  
- Ensuring timely delivery  
- Managing limited resources
